# PyFMT

# Idea behind the solution
Implement a one to one mapping from the AST to a syntax representaion

# Strategy
The problem can be further decomposed into two seperate phases. In the first phase, the problem at hand is to transform the AST to a pep8 compliant representation. In the second stage I take that AST and print the source back.

# Stage 1
NodeTransformers

# Stage 2
NodeVistor.
